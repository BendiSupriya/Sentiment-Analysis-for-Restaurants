**Sentiment-Analysis-for-Restaurants**
This project employs sentiment analysis to classify customer reviews of restaurants, helping both diners and owners. Using a dataset of 1,000 reviews (50% positive and 50% negative), we tested two classification algorithms. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm achieved over 75% accuracy, making it the most effective, while the Bernoulli Naive Bayes performed below this threshold. By analyzing reviews, customers can easily find the best dining options, and restaurant owners gain insights into customer preferences, enabling improvements in service and enhancing the overall dining experience.
